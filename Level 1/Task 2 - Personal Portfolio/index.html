        <h3>TripleX Game</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/isanthecoder/unreal-engine-c--triplex-game"> Github Link</a>
        <p>
            TripleX Unreal Engine Game allows the user to play as a hacker hacking into one of the most secure state facility prison servers to rescue his prison mate. The hacking involves solving a numeric three digit code that gets randomised every time the hacker completes a level. There are five levels in total and every time there are hints given as to what the three code digits add up to or multiply to give. Once successful, a success message is displayed and if the user fails at any level, a message to try again is displayed and the same level is displayed again in the terminal, but the numeric code randomised yet again. It is an interesting game that requires users to be good at mental mathematics skills, reflexes as well as a lot of brainwork in guessing the randomised code at each level every time they play the TripleX game. Hope this game manages to attract the attention of dedicated professional gamers as well as casual gamers who focus and look for brainwork and skills in games, thus allowing many master hackers to rescue their prison mates from their lifelong sentence.
